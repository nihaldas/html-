                    Benedict Arnold led an expedition early in the American Revolutionary War from Cambridge, Massachusetts, through the wilderness of what is 
                    now Maine to the gates of Quebec City, setting out on September 11, 1775. Colonel Arnold's force of 1,100 Continental Army troops was part of a 
                    two-pronged invasion of the British Province of Quebec, along with Richard Montgomery's expedition pushing north from Lake Champlain. By the time 
                    Arnold reached the French settlements above the Saint Lawrence River in November, his force was reduced to 600 starving men. They had traveled
                     about 350 miles (560 km) through poorly charted wilderness, twice the distance they had expected to cover. Assisted by the local French-speaking 
                     Canadiens, Arnold's troops crossed the Saint Lawrence on November 13 and 14 and attempted to put Quebec City under siege. Failing in this, they 
                     withdrew until Montgomery arrived to lead an unsuccessful attack on the city. Arnold received a promotion to brigadier general. His route through 
                     northern Maine has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Arnold Trail to Quebec. (Full article...)

                    Twenty-five centuries were scored in World Series Cricket (WSC) Supertests, and two in international one-day matches. WSC was a professional 
                    cricket competition established by Kerry Packer which ran from 1977 and 1979. The International Cricket Conference barred the WSC from using 
                    the term "Test matches", or naming a team "Australia". As a result, the matches were dubbed "Supertests", while the teams were WSC Australia 
                    XI, WSC West Indies XI and WSC World XI. The first Supertest began on 2 December 1977, although the first century (100 or more runs in a single
                     innings) was not scored until the third match, in which Ian Chappell accumulated 141 runs in the first innings. Bruce Laird and Viv Richards 
                     (pictured) went on to score centuries in the same match. A month later, Barry Richards achieved the competition's first double century, scoring 
                     207 runs for the WSC World XI. Greg Chappell had a record five WSC centuries
